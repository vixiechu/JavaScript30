# JavaScript30

I wanted to improve my understanding of JavaScript and I've enjoyed learning from Wes Bos before, so thought I'd do his #JavaScript30 course. 

## What are these files?

These are my personal training files, all in their own subfolder of what they are, e.g. CSS clock

## Set up

All you have to do is open the file you're working on to see it in the browser, and refresh to reflect your changes.

You can use other tools if you want to, but the purpose of the course is to improve your vanilla JavaScript, so I kept it as basic as possible.
